Augmented Reality Game targeted at Hololens 1/2 designed to teach adolescents about NPBTs (New Plant Breeding Techniques
editing).
The game was part of the dissemination program involved in the [chic.eu](https://chicproject.eu) project. CHIC was a
project that revolved around the Chicory plant, which has the very characteristic flower that you can see in all its
branding and subordinate projects.

I developed the game prototype during my period as Research Assistant
at [DEI Interactive Systems](https://dei.inf.uc3m.es/portal/index.php)
I designed everything in the game, specifically all sprites and 3D objects (except for the insects and weather
particles).
Telmo Zarraonandia Ayo contributed to the development and migration of the application to Hololens 2.

The project was officially re-branded
as [My CHIC Farm](https://chicproject.eu/training-for-high-school-students/mychicfarm/) for unknown reasons (unrelated
to me) but I like this logo best so it's why I put it here.

A scientific article [_Investigating Augmented reality educational games for Head-mounted devices_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471391.3471410) derived from this work was published in 2021 to which I contributed.

Also this videogame is the base for the evaluation of my MsC.

- **Garden in AR**: Players can place flowerpots in their surroundings leveraging the capabilities of Hololens headset
  for generating meshes about the surroundings.
- **3D Inventory system** containing fundamentally two types of Items : seeds and farming spaces (flowerpots). Players
  can pick elements naturally with their hands and place them in the environment (e.g., drop seeds in a flowerpot for it
  to start growing).
- **The shop**: Players can buy new seeds and flowerpots from the shop that get added to their environment.
- **The Lab**: Players can improve the properties of their plants via Random mutations or NPBT gene manipulation. If
  they use the latter they can choose the positive traits they want their new plants to have, and they carry out a gene
  editing mini-game to complete the plant modification process. In this minigame, players are introduce to all the steps
  involved in editing the genes of a plant and the implications.

## Showcase

See a [short video](https://youtu.be/B2ltgGxt7UM) of the game in action. This is the official version of the game.
The following screenshots showcase different features and were captured during development.
